# [petewilliams.space](http://petewilliams.space)
A simple Bootstrap website built using npm + gulp to get by.

Based on [Start Bootstrap - Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/) by David Miller under the [MIT](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE) license.

### Build

* `npm install` - builds node_modules folder, compiles scss, minifies `resume.css`/`resume.js`
* `npm start` - Runs a node server on 3000, browserSync will hot update any changes. `gulpfile.js` currently drives this called by `npm` from `package.json`.

### Hosting
Currently hosted at [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh).
